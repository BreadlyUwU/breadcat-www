## What's dis??
### Is that a post???

Oh, my, god! Imagine all the potential!

Well, maybe I should then speak a little about myself, so‚Ä¶ I am the kind of person who love to prepare for myself the coziest place for anything, that can be my operating system, desktop environment, a comfy Firefox profile, a development env‚Ä¶ a website! But I also have a lot of difficulties to actually get to work, on anything.

So that's maybe a part of the reasons behind the fact that, there's a blog‚Ä¶ *but there's nothing to showcase __(yet)__*.

 `¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø`

 But there's still a lot of stuff I would **love** to make, so that's why I'm learning programmation.

 #### What I'm learning? 
 As said on the [homepage](../..), `Rust`. I'm also learning a bit of `Javascript` since that's not unrelated to what I want to make in the future.

#### What I like?
I love speedruns (watching, but also would love to do some), I love ugly pixelated games, I will probably throw some words about why Sonic Robo Blast 2, Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart and Dr.Robotnik's Rings Racer are the best games ever created. ü¶î

I'm also trying to cut my teeth on [Lexaloffle's Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php), this little thing is a lot of fun And if you've never heard about it, I strongly encourage you to check it out. üê±

#### In the meantime, have a nice day and see you soon c:
